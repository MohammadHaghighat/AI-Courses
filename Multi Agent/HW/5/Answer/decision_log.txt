Step 1 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian or fire, so I need to explore the map to find civilians or fires to rescue/extinguish. Moving right is a valid move and will expand the known area of the map.
Step 1 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am currently at (6, 1), which is on a civilian (2) according to the shared map, and I am not carrying a civilian. Therefore, the highest priority action is to rescue the civilian. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 1 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, I am not on a civilian or fire, and there's no Type 2 fire with my teammate present. I need to explore the map. Moving down seems like a reasonable starting direction. Since no other rule applies, I am exploring unknown territory to find objectives.
Step 1 | Agent B2 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, nor am I standing on a civilian or a fire. I need to explore the map. The nearest unexplored area seems to be down.
Step 2 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian, and not standing on a fire. Therefore, I should move towards the nearest civilian at (1, 1) or (3, 3) to rescue them. Moving right seems to be a good starting direction to explore and find the civilian. I need to avoid the building at (3, 3) and the type 2 fire at (2, 3).
Step 2 | Agent A2 | Action: rescue civilian | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a civilian and not carrying one, so I should rescue the civilian.
Step 2 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian, and not standing on a fire. I need to explore the map to find civilians or fires to increase our team score. Moving down seems like a reasonable direction.
Step 2 | Agent B2 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian or a fire. Therefore, I should move to a location that might contain a civilian or a fire. Moving down will bring me closer to the civilian at (8,9).
Step 3 | Agent A1 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at (1, 3) and not carrying a civilian. The map shows a civilian (2) at (1, 2). Thus I should rescue the civilian at (1, 2) by moving there first. However, I am at (1, 3) standing on empty ground, not a civilian, and there is a civilian at (1, 2) and I am not carrying a civilian, so the action is to rescue civilian. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 3 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and standing on a station (6), so the highest priority is to deliver the civilian. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 3 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not on a station, and not on a fire. There is no type 2 fire to coordinate on, and I'm not carrying a civilian. The map shows the location of my teammate at (8, 9). Since I am at (7, 13), there is no higher priority task. Moving down is a valid move to explore the unknown and potentially find a civilian or fire to address.
Step 3 | Agent B2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian and I am standing on a civilian (2) at (7, 9), so I should rescue the civilian. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 4 | Agent A1 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 2 Fire (7). My teammate is at position (6, 1), not at my position (2, 3). Therefore, rule 3 is not applicable because my teammate is not at the same position. However, if my teammate were at (2,3), I would extinguish the fire. Since I am standing on the fire, I can stay still and hope my teammate moves here next turn. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 4 | Agent A2 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am standing on a station (6), so I must deliver the civilian to score points. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 4 | Agent B1 | Action: move up | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, nor am I standing on a civilian or fire. I need to explore the map and potentially rescue a civilian or extinguish a fire. Moving up seems to be the best direction to start exploring unknown areas.
Step 4 | Agent B2 | Action: rescue civilian | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a civilian and I am not carrying a civilian, so I should rescue the civilian.
Step 5 | Agent A1 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at (1,3) and standing on Empty Ground, but the shared map shows a Type 2 Fire at (2,3). Since my teammate is at (5,0), they are not at the same location, so I cannot extinguish the fire. I must wait for my teammate. However, the current rules do not let me wait. There is also a civilian at (3,3). Since I am not carrying a civilian and standing on a CIVILIAN (2), I can rescue the civilian. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 5 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and am not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). I need to move towards that station. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 5 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian. I am not on a station, a civilian, or a fire. Therefore, I need to explore the map. Moving down seems like a reasonable direction to uncover more of the map and potentially find a civilian or a fire to address.
Step 5 | Agent B2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. I need to move towards the nearest station, which is either at (0,0) or (14,14). Since (14,14) is closer, I will start moving in that direction. The easiest way to move towards it is to move down or right. I will choose right since I am currently at (8,9). (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 6 | Agent A1 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am standing on a Type 2 Fire (7). According to the condition for extinguishing Type 2 Fire, I need to be on a Type 2 Fire and my teammate needs to be at the exact same position. My teammate's position is (6, 0) which is not the same as my position at (2, 3). Therefore the action to extinguish fire is not possible and I need to re-evaluate. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 6 | Agent A2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). Moving left will bring me closer to the station. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 6 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian, and not standing on a fire. The nearest civilian is at (8, 6). Since I am at (8, 13) and there's no indication of obstacles between me and the civilian, I should move towards it to potentially rescue the civilian. Moving down is the first step in that direction.
Step 6 | Agent B2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0) or (14,14). Since my current position is (8,8), I need to move towards either (0,0) or (14,14). Moving towards (0,0) would be a better choice as it is closer to me. The available actions are "move up", "move down", "move left", "move right". I choose move up. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 7 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, nor am I standing on a civilian, fire, or station. There is a civilian at (0,1), so I should move right to (1,4) to clear the building blocking the route. I do not want to go down to (2,3) because there is a Type 2 fire there, so I will not go there until my teammate is there as well. Moving right takes me closer to unknown areas and possibly more civilians.
Step 7 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and currently standing on a station (6). Therefore, I should deliver the civilian. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 7 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian or fire, and there is no type 2 fire with my teammate waiting for me. My priority is to explore the map and potentially rescue civilians. The closest unknown area is to the left. I am at (9,13) and the closest known station is (14, 14) or (0,0). But I want to explore. So I am moving left.
Step 7 | Agent B2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. I need to move towards the nearest station at (0,0) or (14,14). The closest station appears to be (0,0) based on the limited map information. I will prioritize moving towards it. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 8 | Agent A1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian. There is a civilian at (1, 1). Moving left will bring me closer to the civilian at (0,1), then I can rescue the civilian. I am currently at (1, 4). Moving left is a valid move as (1, 3) is empty ground. Rule 2 can be applied after I move left to (1,2).
Step 8 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is (0,0) which is to the left and up. Moving left is a valid move. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 8 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not on a fire, and not on a station. My teammate is at (9,9) and I am at (9,12). There is a Type 2 fire at (6,12). Since I am not on the fire, I will move down to investigate. 
Step 8 | Agent B2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. Therefore, I must move towards the nearest station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). Moving towards (0,0) requires me to move up and left. I choose to move up first. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 9 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian. I am not standing on a civilian, fire, or station. Therefore, I should move towards the closest civilian at (3,4) and (1,2). Move right to (2,3) is the closest available step.
Step 9 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest station, which is at (14, 14). Moving right is the only valid move to get closer. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 9 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian or fire. I need to explore the map. Moving left seems like a reasonable first step as the optimal path is unknown. The teammate is also not on a type 2 fire, so no need to coordinate. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 9 | Agent B2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). Therefore I need to move towards it. Moving left is the optimal move. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 10 | Agent A1 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian, fire, or station. I need to move towards a point of interest. There is a type 1 fire at (4, 4). Moving down will get me closer to that fire.
Step 10 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest station. The stations are located at (0,0) and (14,14). Station (0,0) is closer, so I will move towards it. The valid moves available are to move up, down, left, or right. Moving left is the best option to move towards the station. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 10 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am standing on a Type 2 Fire (7) at (11,12), and my teammate is at the exact same position (9,11). Therefore, I should extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 10 | Agent B2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to move to the nearest station to deliver them. The nearest known station is at (0, 0) or (14, 14). Moving down gets me closer to a potential path to either station. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 11 | Agent A1 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am currently at (2, 4) and standing on a Type 2 Fire (7). My teammate is also at the same position (2, 4), therefore, I can extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 11 | Agent A2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). Therefore, I should move towards the station. Moving left is a valid move. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 11 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (value 3). According to the action selection rules, if I am standing on a Type 1 Fire, I must extinguish it.
Step 11 | Agent B2 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0) or (14,14). Since it is closer, I will move towards (0,0) first. Moving left is the first step. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 12 | Agent A1 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 2 Fire (7), and my teammate is at the exact same position (2, 3). Therefore, I should extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 12 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). I need to move towards it, and moving left is a valid move.
Step 12 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian, and not standing on a fire. My teammate is not standing on a Type 2 fire either. Since I don't have an immediate task, I should explore the map. Moving down seems like a reasonable first step to explore more of the unknown area below.
Step 12 | Agent B2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest station to deliver the civilian. The nearest station is at (14,14). I will move in that direction by moving down. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 13 | Agent A1 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at position (2, 2), which is currently a '4' indicating my agent ID. The shared map shows a Type 2 Fire (7) at (2, 3) and my teammate's position is (7, 1). I am not on fire, and my teammate is not at the same position as the type 2 fire. Therefore, I should not extinguish this fire. But there is type 2 fire on (2, 3), and my current location is (2,2). There is no action available for moving to extinguish fire. But I will follow rule 3. Currently I am standing on Empty Ground (Value: 0), there is no fire under me. It should be an error in current status. Since I am at position (2,2), and there is fire at (2,3), it's not on the same position.  (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 13 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). Therefore, I need to move towards the station. Moving left is a valid move.
Step 13 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not on a station, not on a civilian, and not on a fire. Therefore, I must move. The nearest fire (Type 1 at (13,12)) is on my current tile. I must move to extinguish it, or it will damage me. I can move left to go extinguish the fire at (13,13).
Step 13 | Agent B2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian but not at a station. I need to move towards the nearest station, which is at (0, 0). Moving left is a valid move and gets me closer to the station.
Step 14 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian or a fire. Therefore, I should move towards a civilian or fire. The nearest known civilian is at (1,0), and nearest fire is at (3,0). Moving right gets me closer to both.
Step 14 | Agent A2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). Therefore, I need to move towards the station. I can move left. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 14 | Agent B1 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at (13, 11), which is next to a Type 1 Fire (3) at (13, 13). Per rule #3, I should extinguish the fire. The condition for type 2 fire is not met. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 14 | Agent B2 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station appears to be at (14, 14) or (0,0) based on the shared map. I am currently at (8, 10). Moving down seems like a step towards station location (14,14).
Step 15 | Agent A1 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at (2, 2) which is empty ground, but I can see a type 2 fire at (2, 3) and I can see from the map that there is a Type 2 fire at my current location (2, 2). I am also at the same location as my teammate at (2,2), so the condition for extinguishing type 2 fire is met. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 15 | Agent A2 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station (rule 4). The nearest station is at (0,0). I need to move towards the station, so moving left is the first step. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 15 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, I am not on a civilian, I am not on a Type 1 or Type 2 fire. I am also not carrying a civilian. Therefore, none of the higher priority actions are valid. Since I'm at (12, 11), and there's a Type 1 fire at (13, 13), and a Type 2 fire at (11, 6), and a civilian at (3, 11) and (8, 6), I should move towards one of them. I choose to move down to potentially discover more of the map and possibly get closer to the Type 1 fires to assist later. Also there is no information that my teammate is on fire 7.
Step 15 | Agent B2 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0), so I should move towards it. Since (0,0) is in the top-left, I can start by moving left. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 16 | Agent A1 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at (1,2), and there is a Type 2 Fire (7) at (2,3). My teammate is also at (1,2), so I can extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 16 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and am not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). Therefore, I need to move towards it. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 16 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at (13, 11) and the map shows a Type 1 fire at (13, 11). Rule 3 states that if I am standing on a Type 1 fire, I should extinguish it. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 16 | Agent B2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station (6). Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest known station. The closest station is at (0, 0). I will start by moving up. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 17 | Agent A1 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am currently at (2,2) which is next to a Type 2 fire at (2,3). My teammate is also at (2,2). Thus, I can extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 17 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station is at (0,0), so I need to move left to get closer to it. I can't go down because I don't have enough information to be sure if that path is viable, so moving left is the best option
Step 17 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: Since none of the higher priority conditions are met (I am not carrying a civilian, I am not standing on a civilian, I am not standing on a fire), I need to move towards objectives. The Type 2 fire at (6,11) requires my teammate to be at the same location as me. Since I am currently not carrying a civilian, and there is a type 2 fire, moving towards the fire to potentially extinguish it is a good move. Moving left brings me closer to the type 2 fire.
Step 17 | Agent B2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. The nearest station is at (14, 14). Therefore, I must move towards the station. Since I am at (8, 11), moving right is a valid step to get closer. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 18 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am at (2, 1). The priority rules don't apply. There is a type 2 fire at (2, 3). Since my teammate is not there to help me, I should move towards a type 1 fire to extinguish it or toward a civilian to rescue it. Moving right will take me to (3,1), which is empty ground. Moving down leads to building (1). Moving left is worse. So I will choose to move right.
Step 18 | Agent A2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). I can move left. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 18 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, I am not standing on a civilian, and I am not standing on a fire. Therefore, I should explore the map. The closest unknown area is to my left. Also there's a station to my left at (14,14). 
Step 18 | Agent B2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest known station is at (0, 0), so I should move towards that direction. Valid moves are up, down, left, right. Moving left is a valid move. Alternatively, the other station is at (14,14). Since I am carrying a civilian and am not at a station, I need to move towards the nearest station. Since (0,0) seems like a shorter distance, I will choose that as my destination. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 19 | Agent A1 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at (2,2) which is a Type 2 fire location, and my teammate is also at the same position, so I can extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 19 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and am not at a station. The nearest known station is at (0,0). Therefore, I need to move towards it. Moving left is a valid move as it does not lead into a building. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 19 | Agent B1 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not on a civilian, not on a fire. I need to explore the map and the nearest fire is to my left. Moving left seems like a good move to explore. Also, there's a fire at location (14,13), and I'm at (14,9). This action makes sense because it is safe as location (13,9) is unknown and that it could contain useful information. My teammate is not at a type 2 fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 19 | Agent B2 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0), so I should move towards that direction. Moving left is a valid move since the cell to the left is empty ground. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 20 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am at (2, 1) and there's a type 2 fire at (2, 3). My teammate is not there. Since none of the higher priority rules apply, I should explore to find civilians or fires. Moving right seems like a reasonable direction. I'm not carrying a civilian, and I'm not on a fire or station.
Step 20 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). Therefore, I need to move towards it. I can move left. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 20 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: Since I am not carrying a civilian, not on a civilian or fire, and there is no type 2 fire being handled by the teammate, I should explore the map. There is a station nearby to the left at (14, 14). Moving left will get me closer to that station.
Step 20 | Agent B2 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not standing on a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest known station. The nearest station is at (0, 0), but I am also aware of a station at (14, 14). Since I can't see a clear path to either from the limited map knowledge, I will move up towards the station at (0, 0) as a first step. This action falls under rule 4. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 21 | Agent A1 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at position (2, 2) and standing on Type 2 Fire (7). My teammate is also at (2, 2). Therefore, I should extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 21 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). Therefore, I should move towards it. The map shows no obstacle to the left, so moving left is a valid move. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 21 | Agent B1 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not on a civilian, not on a fire. I need to improve my score and explore the map. Moving left towards the station at (14,14) will get me closer to delivering a civilian when I find one.  (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 21 | Agent B2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0) or (14, 14). Since I am at (7, 12), the station at (0, 0) is closer, so I need to move up or left. Moving left is a valid move. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 22 | Agent A1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), so the highest priority action is to extinguish it.
Step 22 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0), so I need to move left to go towards it. Moving left is a valid move as I am not moving into a building.
Step 22 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not on a civilian, not on a fire, and there is no type 2 fire to coordinate on. Therefore, I should explore to find more civilians or fires. Since I don't have enough information to decide on an optimal path, I will simply move left towards the unknown area, hoping to uncover new information.
Step 22 | Agent B2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest known station. The nearest station is at (0,0). I will move up to get closer to the station. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 23 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am at (1,2). There is no civilian to rescue. I am not carrying a civilian. I am not on a fire. There is a station at (0,0) but also fires close by. Therefore, I should move right toward the Type 1 Fire at (2,2) to potentially extinguish fire next turn.
Step 23 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and am not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest station. The nearest known station is at (0,0). Moving left is a valid move. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 23 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not on a civilian, not on a fire. My highest priority is to explore the map and I will move left towards the fire location. 
Step 23 | Agent B2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station is at (0,0) or (14,14). I will start moving towards (0,0) by moving left. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 24 | Agent A1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3) at position (1, 3). According to rule 3, if I am standing on a Type 1 Fire, I should extinguish it.
Step 24 | Agent A2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest known station is at (0,0). Therefore, I need to move towards it. Moving left is a valid move. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 24 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (Value: 3), and the 'EXTINGUISH FIRE' rule for Type 1 fires takes precedence over other movement options when I am standing on the fire.
Step 24 | Agent B2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). Therefore, I must move towards a station. Moving left seems like the best first step. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 25 | Agent A1 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am currently at (1,3) which is empty ground but based on the shared map there are fire locations. According to rule 3, if I'm standing on a TYPE 1 FIRE (3) I must 'extinguish fire'. However, I am not standing on Type 1 Fire or Type 2 fire. I am standing on (1,3) but the map shows that coordinate (1,3) is empty ground. However, I see a type 2 fire at (2,3), my teammate is not at that coordinate. If there's a type 2 fire and my teammate is at the same location, I should extinguish fire, but since my teammate is at (9,1), the second condition of rule 3 isn't met. Since I am currently standing on empty ground but the map shows a '5' which is my agent at (9,1) and that my agent (myself) is located at (1,3), I see fire Type 1 at coordinates (1,4). So I need to move right one block to that location to meet the condition to execute rule 3. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 25 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest station. The station at (0, 0) is closer than (14, 14). I can move left to move towards the station. Moving down is not an option because of the building. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 25 | Agent B1 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am currently at (13, 7) standing on a Type 2 fire (7). My teammate is also at (9, 10), which is not at (13, 7). Therefore, to extinguish a Type 2 fire, my teammate needs to be at the EXACT SAME position. Since my teammate is NOT at the same position, and I am not carrying a civilian, I will try to extinguish fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 25 | Agent B2 | Action: move up | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). Moving up is a valid move towards the station.
Step 26 | Agent A1 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am standing on a Type 2 Fire (7) and my teammate is at the same position (2, 3). Therefore, I can extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 26 | Agent A2 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). I need to move towards it. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 26 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3) at (14, 7). The condition for extinguishing a Type 1 Fire is met, so I must choose this action.
Step 26 | Agent B2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. The nearest known station is at (0,0). Therefore, I need to move towards it. Moving left is the best option as the current map does not show any obstructions. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 27 | Agent A1 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at (2,2) and there is a Type 2 Fire (7) at (2,2). Since my teammate is also at (2,2) as stated in the problem description, I can extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 27 | Agent A2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently carrying a civilian and standing on a Type 1 Fire (3). According to the action selection rules, the 'EXTINGUISH FIRE' action takes precedence over 'MOVE TO DELIVER' when standing on a fire.
Step 27 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: Since I am not carrying a civilian, not on a civilian, and not on a fire, I need to explore and gather more information. Since the agent is at (14, 7) it should move left to investigate the fires at (13, 7), (12, 7) etc.
Step 27 | Agent B2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest known station is at (0,0). Moving left brings me closer to that station. I am currently at (8,9).
Step 28 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not on a civilian, not on a fire, and my teammate is not on a Type 2 fire. Since the higher priority actions are not applicable, I need to explore the map. Moving right seems like a good option as it moves toward unexplored territory, and doesn't run into a building.
Step 28 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). Moving left is the first step towards that station.
Step 28 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), and the highest priority rule is to extinguish a fire when standing on it.
Step 28 | Agent B2 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest known station, which are at (0,0) and (14,14). Since the station at (0,0) is closer than (14,14), moving up is the best option to eventually get there. I can't use any other actions. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 29 | Agent A1 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at (2, 2) and standing on a Type 2 Fire (7). My teammate is also at (2, 2), thus satisfying the condition to extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 29 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). I need to move towards it. Moving left is a valid move. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 29 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not on a civilian, nor on a fire. I should explore to discover more of the map and potentially find civilians or fires. Moving left is the only available direction to move towards based on the provided map. My teammate is not waiting to put out Type 2 fire.
Step 29 | Agent B2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0) or (14,14). Since my coordinates are (7,8), moving left towards (0,0) seems the best option for delivering the civilian. I will start by moving left. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 30 | Agent A1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am at (2,1), not carrying a civilian, and not on a civilian, station, or fire. The teammate is not at my position. Moving left towards the station at (0, 0) is a good option to potentially deliver a civilian later or to explore the map.
Step 30 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). I am at (8,2). Moving left will get me closer to the station.
Step 30 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3) at (14, 5), and the 'EXTINGUISH FIRE' action takes precedence over other actions when this condition is met.
Step 30 | Agent B2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest station. The nearest known station is at (0,0) or (14,14). Since I am at (7,7), both stations are roughly equidistant. I will move towards the station at (14,14) by moving down. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 31 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am at (2, 0). I am not carrying a civilian, nor am I on a station or a civilian. I am not on a fire. There are fires on the map, but I need to move towards them. I should move towards the fires on the top left of the map and move right. Moving right takes me closer to the fires.
Step 31 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). I can move left towards it. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 31 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: Since none of the higher priority actions are applicable, I will move towards the Type 2 Fire at (12, 5). Moving left is a valid move towards it.
Step 31 | Agent B2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and am not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest station. The stations are located at (0,0) and (14,14). Since I am at (7,8), moving towards (0,0) is more feasible. A valid move would be 'move left'. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 32 | Agent A1 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at (2, 1) and standing on Empty Ground (0). However, my teammate is at (8, 2). I am at (2, 1). There is a Type 2 Fire (7) at (2, 3). But my teammate is not at the same position. I am on (2,1) which is Empty Ground (0). However, according to the map, there is a Type 1 Fire (3) at (2, 2). Rule 3 says if I am standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), I should extinguish fire. I am standing on Empty Ground. However, the rules also say that my agent is at (2, 1). So I am Agent 1. According to the map, I am at (2, 1) which is Agent 1. Therefore, since I am currently standing on Empty Ground, I cannot apply rule 3. Since I am not carrying a civilian, I cannot apply rule 1 or rule 4. There is a Type 2 fire, but my teammate is not there, so I can't apply rule 5. There is a Type 1 fire at (2, 2), but I am not standing on it, so I can't apply rule 3. However, based on the instructions, my position is (2,1) and I am Agent 1 which means '4' on the map represents me at my location. Thus, I am standing on Empty Ground (0). Since no rules apply, I should move towards fire. There is fire at (2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(5,4). I will move to the closest fire at (2, 2). The shared map is correct since it shows that my agent, represented by 4, is currently at (2, 1). Thus, I am at (2, 1) which is empty ground. So none of the rules apply. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 32 | Agent A2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), so I should extinguish it.
Step 32 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), so the 'extinguish fire' action is the highest priority.
Step 32 | Agent B2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian, but I am not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). Therefore, I need to move towards it. Since I cannot determine the optimal path, I will move left. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 33 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, I am not on a civilian, and I am not on a fire. Therefore, I need to explore. There is fire to the right of me. Moving right could potentially allow me to extinguish the fire on the next turn or move towards the station.
Step 33 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). Since I am at (8,2), I should move left to get closer to the station, while avoiding buildings.
Step 33 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not on a civilian, and not on a fire. I need to explore the map to find civilians or fires to increase our score. Moving left will move me closer to the station and potentially reveal more of the map in that direction.
Step 33 | Agent B2 | Action: move up | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). I should move up one cell.
Step 34 | Agent A1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), so according to rule 3, I should extinguish it.
Step 34 | Agent A2 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. I need to move towards the nearest station, which is at (0,0). Moving left is a valid move since the map value is 0. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 34 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3) at position (14, 3). According to rule 3, if I am standing on a Type 1 fire, I should extinguish it.
Step 34 | Agent B2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently carrying a civilian and standing on a Type 1 Fire (Value: 3). According to the action selection rules, the priority is to extinguish the fire when standing on it.
Step 35 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently at (1, 2) on empty ground and not carrying a civilian. There is type 1 fire (3) around me, but I am not standing on it. There is no Type 2 Fire I can extinguish because my teammate is not on a fire and I am not on the same position as them. I need to move to reach a fire. Moving right seems like a reasonable direction to encounter a fire.
Step 35 | Agent A2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3) and carrying a civilian, but the extinguish fire rule takes precedence over moving to deliver the civilian.
Step 35 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian, and not on a fire. My teammate is not at the same position. There is no station nearby, so I should move to extinguish the fire at (13,3). Moving left will get me closer to the fire.
Step 35 | Agent B2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. The nearest station is at (14, 14). Therefore, I need to move towards the station. Moving right is the only possible move. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 36 | Agent A1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), so I should extinguish it according to rule 3.
Step 36 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). I can move left towards it. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 36 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (Value: 3), therefore I need to extinguish it. Rule 3 applies.
Step 36 | Agent B2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently carrying a civilian and standing on a Type 1 Fire (3). According to the action selection rules, extinguishing the fire has higher priority than moving to deliver the civilian in this situation.
Step 37 | Agent A1 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at (1, 3) and standing on Empty Ground (0), but there is Type 1 Fire (3) immediately surrounding me. Since the Extinguish Fire rule has priority over movement, I will choose to extinguish the fire on which I am standing which is technically adjacent to me but I interpret it as being on the same space due to the map rendering. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 37 | Agent A2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian, but I am standing on a Type 1 Fire (3). Therefore, I should extinguish the fire first based on rule 3.
Step 37 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian or fire, and my teammate is not at my location. The highest priority is to extinguish a type 2 fire. Since my teammate is not at my location, I must move. Moving left is the only move available that does not move onto a building (obstacle). I will move left and hope to extinguish fire next turn.
Step 37 | Agent B2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station (6). I need to move towards the nearest known station. The closest station is at (14, 14), so I will move to deliver the civilian. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 38 | Agent A1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), so the highest priority action is to extinguish it.
Step 38 | Agent A2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and am not at a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). Therefore, I need to move towards it. Moving left is a valid move as it's not a building. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 38 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), and according to the rules, the highest priority action in this situation is to extinguish the fire.
Step 38 | Agent B2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (Value: 3) and the highest priority rule is to extinguish the fire when standing on it.
Step 39 | Agent A1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: Since I am at (0, 3) on empty ground and there is a Type 1 fire to the left at (0,2), (0,1) and (0,0) which is also a station, moving left is the best option to potentially extinguish fire or deliver civilian in future steps.
Step 39 | Agent A2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and standing on a Type 1 Fire (3). According to the action selection rules, extinguishing the fire takes precedence over other actions, even when carrying a civilian. Rule 3 states that if I am standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), I should extinguish it.
Step 39 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not on a civilian, fire, or station. The nearest known station is at (14, 14). I am at (14, 1). Therefore, I should move left to get closer to it.
Step 39 | Agent B2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0) or (14,14). Considering my current position, I should move towards either of them. I'll start by moving left. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 40 | Agent A1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), so I should extinguish it according to rule 3.
Step 40 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). Moving left will bring me closer to it. Rule 4 applies.
Step 40 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am standing on a Type 1 Fire (3) at (14, 0), which satisfies the condition for extinguishing a Type 1 fire according to rule 3.
Step 40 | Agent B2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently carrying a civilian and standing on a Type 1 Fire (3). According to the rules, I should extinguish the fire. 
Step 41 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, not standing on a civilian or a fire. The only applicable rule is to move. Moving right seems like the best option to eventually explore the map and potentially find civilians or fires. I need to avoid buildings.
Step 41 | Agent A2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). Moving left will get me closer to the station. I am avoiding buildings (1). (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 41 | Agent B1 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am at position (14, 0) which is next to Type 1 fire (3), and my teammate is at the same position (14, 0) which is not next to Type 2 Fire (7). Thus, the conditions for extinguishing a Type 2 fire are not met. The higher priority is to extinguish Type 1 fire if I am on it. So, I will extinguish Type 1 fire at my current location. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 41 | Agent B2 | Action: move left | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. I need to move towards the nearest station, which is at (0, 0). Since I am at (7, 8), moving up is a valid move. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 42 | Agent A1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), so according to rule 3, I should extinguish the fire.
Step 42 | Agent A2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently carrying a civilian and standing on a Type 1 Fire (3). Rule 3 dictates that I should extinguish the fire.
Step 42 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), so I need to extinguish it.
Step 42 | Agent B2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian, but the primary condition I need to fulfill is extinguishing the fire since I'm currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3). The 'extinguish fire' action takes precedence over delivering the civilian in this situation.
Step 43 | Agent A1 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am not carrying a civilian, nor am I on a Civilian or Fire. I must choose a valid move. Moving down allows me to explore the map since I am currently on Empty Ground. I choose to move down rather than right as I wish to avoid the fires to the right for now.
Step 43 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). Moving left will get me closer to the station.
Step 43 | Agent B1 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am standing on a Type 2 fire (7) at (14, 1), and my teammate is also at (14, 1). Therefore, I should extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 43 | Agent B2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). Therefore, I need to move towards it. Moving left is a valid move. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 44 | Agent A1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), and the highest priority rule is to extinguish the fire.
Step 44 | Agent A2 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and am not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). Therefore, I need to move towards the station. Moving left is the best option to get closer to (0,0). (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 44 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), and according to rule 3, if I am on a Type 1 Fire, I should extinguish it.
Step 44 | Agent B2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently carrying a civilian and standing on a Type 1 Fire (3). According to the action selection rules, extinguishing the fire takes priority over moving to deliver the civilian.
Step 45 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am currently at (1, 3). The map shows that position contains a type 1 fire (3). Therefore, I must extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 45 | Agent A2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently carrying a civilian and standing on a Type 1 Fire (3). According to the action selection rules, extinguishing the fire (rule 3) takes precedence over moving to deliver the civilian (rule 4).
Step 45 | Agent B1 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am currently at position (14, 2) which is next to a Type 2 fire (7) at (12,6) and (13,5), but am not standing on one, but my teammate is not at the exact same position (14, 2). I am standing on empty ground (value: 0). Therefore, I will look for the next most appropriate action. There is a Type 1 fire at (12, 0). Therefore, I will move to the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 45 | Agent B2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). I need to move towards it. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 46 | Agent A1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), which satisfies the condition for extinguishing fire. Therefore, I will extinguish the fire.
Step 46 | Agent A2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and I am not at a station. The nearest station is at (0,0). I should move left to get closer to the station. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 46 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), and therefore must choose the 'extinguish fire' action according to rule #3.
Step 46 | Agent B2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently carrying a civilian and standing on a Type 1 Fire (3). According to the rules, I should extinguish the fire.
Step 47 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am currently at (1, 4) and according to the map, there is a Type 1 Fire (3) at my location. Therefore, I should extinguish the fire. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 47 | Agent A2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3) and carrying a civilian. According to rule 3, if I am standing on a Type 1 Fire, I should extinguish it.
Step 47 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: My current location is (13, 2) which is Empty Ground. I am not carrying a civilian. There is a Type 2 fire at (6,12) but my teammate is not there. I am not standing on a fire. The nearest known station is at (14, 14), but since I am not carrying a civilian, I will prioritize moving towards the civilian at (12, 3). So I need to move left.
Step 47 | Agent B2 | Action: move down | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. The nearest station is at (14, 14). Moving down is a valid move that brings me closer to the station, avoiding buildings.
Step 48 | Agent A1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), so the highest priority action is to extinguish it.
Step 48 | Agent A2 | Action: move up | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and am not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest station, which is at (0,0). Moving left is the valid move towards the station. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 48 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3) and I am not carrying a civilian, so I should extinguish the fire.
Step 48 | Agent B2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3) and carrying a civilian. Rule 3 (Extinguish Fire) takes precedence over other actions when on a fire.
Step 49 | Agent A1 | Action: move right | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently on empty ground and not carrying a civilian. There are no immediate conditions to extinguish a fire or rescue a civilian. I should move towards the known fires at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) etc to potentially extinguish them. Moving right is a valid direction since there are no buildings blocking the way. 
Step 49 | Agent A2 | Action: move down | Fallback: True | Reasoning: Fallback due to error: 
Step 49 | Agent B1 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: Since none of the higher priority actions are applicable, I need to explore and gather more information about the map. Moving left seems like a reasonable direction to start exploring the unknown areas to the west. I want to avoid getting stuck in the fire area and hopefully find more civilians or fire to extinguish.
Step 49 | Agent B2 | Action: move right | Fallback: True | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and not at a station. Therefore, I need to move towards the nearest station, which is either at (0,0) or (14,14). Since I am at (9,8), moving towards (0,0) seems more efficient. I should move up, down, left, or right, avoiding buildings. The path up towards (0,0) is blocked by fire at (9,5), so I will move left. (Fallback used due to invalid action)
Step 50 | Agent A1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), so I must extinguish it according to rule 3.
Step 50 | Agent A2 | Action: move left | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am carrying a civilian and need to deliver them to a station. The nearest station is at (0, 0). Moving left is the closest move towards that station, avoiding any buildings.
Step 50 | Agent B1 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), and according to rule 3, the highest priority applicable rule, I should extinguish the fire.
Step 50 | Agent B2 | Action: extinguish fire | Fallback: False | Reasoning: I am currently standing on a Type 1 Fire (3), and according to the rules, the highest priority action in this scenario is to extinguish the fire.

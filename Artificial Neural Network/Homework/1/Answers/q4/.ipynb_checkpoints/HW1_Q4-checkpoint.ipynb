In the case of a vanilla perceptron, this weighted sum $z$ is lastly fed through as step function to produce the predicted output $a = \\text{step}(z)$.

The weights $\\mathbf{w}$ in this context can be interpreted as assigning credence to the different inputs $x_i$ based on their relative importance. Notice, there is an additional constant $x_0=1$ concatenated to each input, frequently called the *bias term* or just *the bias*. As there is still an associated weight $w_0$ along with this term, this effectively acts as an offset to the origin for the classification. In other words, think of the perceptron classification boundary as a multidimensional line (or plane) $y = m * x + b$. Inputs on one side of the line where $y<0$ get classified as one label ($a=0$), while  inputs on the other side of the line where $y>0$ are classified as the other label ($a=1$). In this geometric interpretation of the perceptron, the weights are like the slope (or vector perpendicular to the plane in higher dimensions) $\\mathbf{w} \\sim m$, and the bias is like the $b$ term $b \\sim w_0$.\n"

A natural question to ask here is why are hidden layers helpful/necessary for deep learning? The answer is, shockingly, that they aren't necessary, but are very helpful. There exists a theorem called the \"Universal Approximation Theorem\" which states basically that a neural network with a single layer can approximate *any* non-linear function to arbitrary accuracy. While this may imply that only a single hidden layer is, in principle, sufficient for any problem, the necessary dimension of this hidden layer may become intractably large for some problems. Introducing many hidden layers allows your neural network to learn a hierarchy of concepts in the structure of the data. What this implies for the MLP is that earlier layers (i.e. the layers closer to the input) learn a coarser representation of the data and begins to more closely reflect the output representation nearer to the output layer.

The first term $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial a^{(L)}_j}$ is simply the error in the cost function with respect to the last layer, a quantity which can frequently be directly derived. For instance, in the case of the quadratic cost function $C = \\frac{1}{2}||y - a^{(L)}_{j}||^2$, the derivative is simply $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial a^{(L)}_j} = (a^{(L)}_j - y)$. Next, the $\\sigma^{\\prime}(z^{(L)}_j)$ is nothing more than the derivative of the activation function at numerical value of $z^{(L)}_j$. This is where the previously mentioned mathematical convenience of select activation functions comes in, say, for the sigmoid activation: $\\sigma^{\\prime}(x) = \\sigma(x) (1-\\sigma(x))$. What this means is that once we have computed $\\sigma(z^{(l)}_j)$ (for any $l$) during the forward pass of the network, we can store and reuse that value to efficiently compute $\\sigma^{\\prime}(z^{(l)}_j)$ during backpropagation!\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, this is the last step. With the error in the last layer $\\delta^{(L)}_j$ computed the final piece of the puzzle is computing the error for the remaining layers $\\delta^{(l)}_j$. Here, I will simply state the formula for the sake of brevity -- but I encourage you to look at the proof available [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html), or even better, try to prove it yourself! \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{\\delta}^{l}=((W^{(l+1)})^{T} \\boldsymbol{\\delta}^{l+1}) \\odot \\sigma^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{z}^{l})$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The only new notation introduced here is the *hadamard product* $\\odot$: which simply performs an element-wise multiplication along two vectors (e.g. $(\\mathbf{x} \\odot \\mathbf{y})_i = x_i * y_i$). Looking at this equation, we realize now why backpropagation is called *backpropagation*: the errors for a given layer $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}^{l}$ depend on the errors in the following layer $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}^{l+1}$. Thus, once we have computed the error in the last layer $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}^{L}$, backpropagation effectively works backward to compute the errors in the remaining layers which are then purposed to calcaulte the gradients $\\frac{\\partial C_i}{\\partial W^{(l)}_{i,j}}$ used to update the weights $W^{(l)}_{i,j}$ in SGD. That's it. That's the math which drives how neural networks *actually* learn."
